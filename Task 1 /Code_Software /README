Project Tools Overview

This project includes two decision-support tools designed to help communities evaluate their readiness level for zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) evacuations.

1. ZEV Score Calculator (by Osman Saleem)
The first tool, developed by Osman Saleem, provides an online calculator to estimate a community’s ZEV Readiness Score.
You can access it here:

Additional resources:

In the Presentations folder, you will find the slides presented during Workshop 2, which introduced this tool.

In the Papers folder, you can find the publication titled “Development of Zero-Emission Vehicle Evacuation Readiness Score Formulation Methodology.”

2. Fuzzy Logic Assessment Tool (by Clotilde Robert)
The second tool, developed by Clotilde Robert in MATLAB, focuses on evaluating the Charging Infrastructure indicators.
All the necessary code is available in the MATLAB folder.
This tool was developed based on the methodology presented in the paper “Are Communities Ready to Evacuate with Zero-Emission Vehicles?”, available in the Papers folder.
