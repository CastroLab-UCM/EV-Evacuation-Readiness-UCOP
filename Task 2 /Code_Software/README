The file Tool1_EnergyAndChargingNeeds helps communities estimate their energy requirements during an evacuation based on the number of electric vehicles (EVs).
This tool also calculates the number of Level 2 and Level 3 chargers needed to meet the total energy demand during the evacuation.

You can find a detailed presentation of this tool in the Presentations folder under the file 3_EnergyAndChargingNeeds, which was delivered during Workshop 2.
The tool is also described in the paper “Planning for Electric-Vehicle Evacuations: Energy, Infrastructure, and Storage Needs”, available in the Papers folder.

In the MATLAB folder, you will find the code used for the paper titled “Planning for Electric-Vehicle Evacuations: Energy, Infrastructure, and Storage Needs.”
